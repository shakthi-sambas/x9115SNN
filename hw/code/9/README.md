###I. Abstract
The Prime Objective of this Project is to optimize DTLZ models (DTZ1 , DTZ3 ,DTZ5 ,DTZ7) using GA algorithm. During optimization our goal  is to identify best decision for the desired objectives.

Result (High level single sentence on what we find)


###II. Background

Genetic Algorithm is an adaptive strategy and type of local search that mimics  evolution by taking population of strings which encode possible solutions and combines them based on a fitness function to produce individuals that are more fit. There are five major states in GA. 1. Initial Population 2. Fitness Function 3.Selection 4. CrossOver 5. Mutation. Initial population begins with randomly generated states. Fitness function produces next generation of states. In selection, based on the scores given by the Fitness function we identify the suitable candidates randomly.  For example in the case of biological evolution we determine how likely an individual  able to reproduce and drop the candidates who are longer able to reproduce. The selected candidates go through cross over state, in the cross over state few random cross over points is chosen to mix the genetic information to setup the different candidates and their offsprings. In the next phase we subject the offsprings to mutation with a small random probability. This is the basis of genetic algorithm and this iterative process may result in an improved adaptive-fit between the phenotypes of individuals in a population and the environment.
