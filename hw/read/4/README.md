## I KeyWords

#### I1. Directed Random Testing
Basically Directed Random Testing is a black box software testing in which programs are executed by generating random inputs.Results of the outputs are compared against given software requirements to verify thatt the test output is pass or fail. 

#### I2. Concloic Testing
Concloic Testing is a hybrid software verification Technique in which it combines symbolic and concrete execution and more specifically using such a combination to generate test inputs to explore all possible execution paths.

#### I3. Automatic Test Genration

Automatic Test Generation is a method  which uses technology from formal methods to mechanize or automate the construction of test cases. This is a model based  development where an executable specification of the program is translated to language of model checker and it is the one generate tests automatically.

#### I4. Test Oracles
Test oracles are the ones which identify the common classes of errors when it occurred.  it basically gives the feed back on each execution of the program like whether the execution is simply passed or failed using assertions.

## II Brief Notes

#### II1. Motivational Statements



#### II2. Delivery Tools




#### II3. Statistical Tests




#### II4. Related Work



## III Areas of Improvement

#### III1.
The author chooses six different web applications, but apart from their size, he didn't mention how these applications qualified for experimental studies. It would have been useful if the criterias for selecting application were specified.

#### III2. 
The tests were conducted on a simple hardware setup and also tested locally. So it is difficult to generalize the testing results. It would have been more value added if they had tested this using medium size cluster and also setup remote services in a distributed envrionment.

#### III3.

All the applications chosen for the study are PHP applications. To cover major wides area of web applications they could have selected other applications implemented by other languages like Java to see the overall effectivness and efficiency of this approach.
