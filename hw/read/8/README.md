## I KeyWords

#### I1. SBSE (Software based Search Engineering)
Software based search engineering means using computation search as a tool or technique to optimize software engineering problems. SBSE has been used to address challenging software engineering problems with large and complex search spaces, characterized by many conflicting competing objectives, in many software related areas.

#### I2. SPL (Software Product Lines)
Software product line is a collection of related software products all of which share some core functionality, yet each of which differs  in some specific features. These differences in the features offered by each product help the product line to capture the variability required by different users, different platforms and various operating environments.


#### I3. Genetic Programming
Genetic Programming is an evolutionary algorithm inspired by biological evolution to find computer programs that perform a user defined task.  Essentially genetic programming  is a set of instructions and a fitness function to measure how well a computer has performed a task. 


#### I4. Program Synthesis
Program synthesis is the task of automatically discovering an executable piece of code given user intent expressed using various forms of constraints such as input-output examples, demonstrations, natural language, etc. 

## II Brief Notes

#### II1. Motivational Statements
There is a tremendous upsurge in SBSE for SPL area and the authorâ€™s team did a  comprehensive work on topics like recent advances in genetic engineering, search based branch merge and Graft Genetic improvement. Based on their exhaustive study they also highlighted in the direction for future work. They mainly focused on  genetic improvements and showing how these improvements  might be exploited by SPL researchers and practitioners.
